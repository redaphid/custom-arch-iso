# AI-Assisted Arch Linux Installer ISO

## Project Goal
Create a bootable Arch Linux ISO that boots directly into an AI-powered installation assistant using fast-agent with ollama and a local LLM (Qwen2.5 7B), providing an interactive AI interface to guide and execute the entire Arch Linux installation process.

## Current Status (2025-09-25)

### What's Working
1. **Build System**: Docker-based ISO build process using archiso
2. **Model Caching**: Ollama binary and Qwen2.5 7B model cached locally in tmp/
3. **Package Caching**: Python wheels for fast-agent-mcp cached
4. **ISO Generation**: Successfully creates bootable ISOs in isos/ directory with ISO 8601 naming

### Known Issues
1. **Runtime Downloads**: Python packages still downloading at runtime instead of being pre-installed
2. **Fast-agent Not Auto-Starting**: Need to verify auto-launch into fast-agent 'go' interface
3. **arch-chroot Issues**: Package installation during build not working properly

## Critical Requirements

### ULTRATHINK Directive
When working on this project, use methodical, careful thinking at every step. Do not reward hack. Do not take shortcuts. Test thoroughly and verify everything works as intended.

### Boot Sequence Requirements
1. **NO DOWNLOADS AT RUNTIME** - Everything must be pre-installed in squashfs
2. **AUTO-LAUNCH FAST-AGENT** - Boot directly into `fast-agent go` interface
3. **OFFLINE CAPABLE** - Must work without network connection
4. **READ-ONLY SQUASHFS** - All packages baked into compressed filesystem

### Testing Requirements

#### Automated Testing Protocol
1. **Build Verification**
   - Check ISO size is reasonable (1.5-2GB expected)
   - Verify ISO is bootable
   - Confirm all files present in squashfs

2. **Boot Testing**
   - Use QEMU with serial console to capture output
   - Parse boot logs for errors
   - Verify services start correctly
   - Check no package downloads occur

3. **Functionality Testing**
   - Verify fast-agent launches automatically
   - Test AI interaction works
   - Confirm Ollama service running
   - Check models are loaded

4. **Network Testing**
   - Boot with network disabled
   - Verify everything still works offline
   - No attempts to download packages

#### Test Commands
```bash
# Build ISO
./download-model.sh  # One-time cache setup
./docker-build.sh    # Build ISO

# Test with text capture
./test-iso-headless.sh  # Captures serial output

# Test with SSH
./test-iso.sh  # GUI mode with SSH on port 2222
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost  # Password: root

# Check for downloads
grep -i "downloading\|download\|pip install\|npm install" /tmp/qemu-boot*.log

# Verify services
systemctl status ollama
systemctl status ai-installer
ps aux | grep fast-agent
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Package Installation Strategy
- **Current Approach**: Use customize_airootfs.sh to install during mkarchiso build
- **Issue**: mkarchiso runs customize script in chroot after packages installed
- **Solution**: Install packages in build.sh before mkarchiso runs

### Service Configuration
- **ollama.service**: Starts Ollama server on boot
- **ai-installer.service**: Auto-launches fast-agent go on tty1
- **sshd.service**: Enabled for debugging (root/root)

### File Locations
- `/usr/local/bin/ollama` - Ollama binary
- `/var/lib/ollama/models` - Model storage
- `/root/.config/fast-agent/fastagent.config.yaml` - Fast-agent config
- `/usr/bin/ai-installer` - Convenience command
- `/root/ai-installer.py` - Python launcher script

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Fix package pre-installation in squashfs
2. Verify fast-agent auto-starts on boot
3. Test with network disabled
4. Optimize boot time

### Testing Methodology
1. Build ISO
2. Test boot with serial console capture
3. Parse logs for any download attempts
4. SSH in to verify package installation
5. Check fast-agent is running on tty1
6. Test AI interaction
7. Repeat with network disabled

### Decision Log
- **SSH Enabled**: Added root/root SSH for debugging without user prompt
- **16GB RAM for QEMU**: Increased from 8GB for Qwen model performance
- **customize_airootfs.sh**: Using mkarchiso's native customization method
- **No Virtual Disk**: ISO must work entirely from RAM/squashfs

## Important Notes
- User is away - make decisions and continue testing
- Do not hallucinate test results - actually verify
- Document all changes and test results
- Keep iterating until it works perfectly
- No shortcuts or hardcoding test expectations
